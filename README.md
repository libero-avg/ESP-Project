# ESP Integration and C# Database Practice Project

This project is being developed by two friends, with a shared passion for learning and innovation. A pre-configured database will be included to simplify setup and testing. While the project heavily uses **C#**, **C++** also plays a significant role, particularly in the firmware development for the ESP devices.

## Features

### Core Functionalities:
- **User Authentication**:
  - Account creation and login.
  - Password management and recovery.

- **Account Settings**:
  - Modify personal details.
  - Update security preferences.

### ESP Device Integration:
- **Wi-Fi Scanning**:
  - Initiate and display available networks from ESP devices.

- **LED Control**:
  - Turn LEDs on/off via the application.

- **Sensor-Based Features** (Optional):
  - Object detection using an external sensor connected to the ESP.
